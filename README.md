I'm a software developer based in Camarillo, California. I enjoy hanging out with my beautiful family and 4 rescue dogs, technology, automation, [music](https://coryd.dev/now#artists), [writing](https://coryd.dev), [reading](https://coryd.dev/now#books) and [tv](https://coryd.dev/now#tv) and [movies](https://coryd.dev/now#movies).

I build, maintain and design web applications. I've been coding professionally since 2010 with a focus on frontend technologies. I help organize [the Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/) and mentor through [Underdog Devs](https://www.underdogdevs.org).
