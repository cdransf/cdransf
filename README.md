I'm a software developer in Camarillo, California. I enjoy hanging out with my beautiful family and 4 rescue dogs, technology, automation, [music](https://music.apple.com/profile/cdransf), [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/coryd) and [tv](https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf) and [movies](https://trakt.tv/users/cdransf).

I build, maintain and design web applications. I've been coding professionally since 2010 with a focus on frontend technologies. I help organize [the Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/) and mentor for [Underdog Devs](https://www.underdogdevs.org/).
